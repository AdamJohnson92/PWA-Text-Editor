  ## Description
  This is a progressive web application that functions as a text editor.

  ## Installation
  This application uses several npm packages in the package.json files, so an 'npm install' will be necessary.To build the dist folder for the pwa deployment, users will also need to use 'npm run build' at the root level of the application. They can then fireup both the client and the server at the same time with 'npm run start:dev".

  ## Usage
  Once installed, this is a text editor that saves what is being typed into it into an IndexedDB object store. In order to see the changes that have been saved to IndexedDB, users can hit the refresh button when viewing IndexedDB storage (in the screenshot below, the refresh button is the circular arrow under the Network tab). Users can click the install button to save the application to their desktop.
